# Capstone Project Plan
_Please enter your project information below for your capstone project idea and your plan for completion_

# Outline
#### Basic Description of your project/idea
- Group : Dyllan, Jian 
- Project : Snake game

#### Additional Details, how you envision it working, important notes to consider, etc...
- When the player collides with a fruit, snake gets longer.
- If the player collides with itself or the wall, they lose the game.

#### How will you incoporate each of the following:
**Module 1 - Variables and Output**
- If game is won/lost, print output for winner/loser
- If snake eats deadly fruit, print output about danger
- loop constant output of snake length/score 
**Module 2 - Object Orientation and Inputs**
- [WASD] or [arrow keys] to move
- 
**Module 3 - Math, Returns, and/or Constructors**
- Snake size stuffs [when snake eats fruit, +1 tail size] [Snake eats deadly fruit -1 tail size]
- 
- 
**Module 4/5 - Conditionals and Loops**
- The snake will be on a moving loop until it either hits itself or dies to the deadly fruits ([WASD] or [arrow keys] to move)
- loop constant output of snake length/score for the player
- 
**Module 6/7 - Arrays OR ArrayLists**
- Different fruits that show up, decided from a list [Ex. skeleton fruit = lose 1 tail limb (if snake size is > ~30, skeleton fruit wont appear)]
- high score array
**Module 8 - Optional: 2D Arrays**

#### Basic idea of split of work? Tasks assigned to each other?
